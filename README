Overview
========

rt_schedtest is a user-space tool that implements online schedulability testing  
of real time tasks. It incorporates, among others, context switch overheads and IPI 
latencies.

Currenntly cache related preemption and migiration delay is given by the user. a default 
value is set otherwise.


Input
====

- The schedulability test name to be performed.

- rt_schedtest accepts as input a file featuring the parameters necessary to make 
a schedulability test. The following is an example:

320613 	     "CXS(Cycles)"
6802366	     "SCHED(Cycles)"
40854	     "SCHED2(Cycles)"
7071618      "RELEASE(Cycles)"
0	     "SEND_RESCHED(Cycles)"
16448911     "RELEASE_LATENCY(NS)"
955 12831471 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
958 12796310 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
954 16500031 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
953 1642999 0 100000000  "id exec_time deadline period"	
959 12726031 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
957 12901471 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
956 16538001 0 100000000 "id exec_time deadline period"
End

Remarks:
- The text in "" is for illustrative purposes; The actual file contains only numbers and the End marker

Output
======
The result of the schedulability test.

Usage
=====

* rt_schedtest [--timestamps] [--overheads] [--cpmd <CPMD>] [--stf <inputfilename.stf>]
  starts online schedulabilty testing of the given real time tasks where inputfilename.stf
  is the name of the file containing the diffrent parameters needed to implement a schedulability 
  test. 
  
    --timestamps 	   Print timestamps.
    --overheads	     	   Print overheads.
    --cpmd  	     	   Cache preemption and migration delay.
    --stf 		   Input schedulability test file.
    --density-test

CREDIT
======

During the development of rt_schedtest, parsing of timestamps was inspired by ft2csv (B.Brandebburg).
LIBLITMUS's makefile is also used in rt_schedtest.
