Overview
========

rt_schedtest is a user-space tool that implemets onlin  schedulability  
of real time tasks. It incorporates overhead like context switch overheads and IPI 
latencies.

Currenntly cache related preemption and migiration delay is given by the user. a default 
value is set otherwise.

Usage
=====

* rt_schedtest [--pts] [--cpmd <CPMD>] <RT_TASK_ID1> <RT_TASK_ID2>...
  starts online schedulabilty testing of the given real time tasks where RT_TASK_ID
  is the id of the process implementing RT_TASK with the given (optional) cache related
  preemption and migration delay.

    --pts   Print timestamps.
    --cpmd  Cache preemption and migration delay.



CREDIT
======

During the development of rt_schedtest, parsing of timstamps was inspired by ft2csv (B.Brandebburg).
LIBLITMUS's makefile is also used in rt_schedtest.
